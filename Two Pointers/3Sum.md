**Problem Statement**

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: [[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The only possible triplet sums up to 0.
```

Constraints:

`3 <= nums.length <= 3000`
`-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`

**Step 1: Understanding and Visualization**
To better understand the problem, let's take a look at an example:

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
```

We need to find all triplets (nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]) such that i != j, i != k, j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] = 0.

The input array nums contains [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]. We need to identify all unique triplets whose sum is equal to zero.

**Step 2: Brute Force Approach**
A simple but potentially inefficient way to solve this problem is by using three nested loops to generate all possible triplets and check if their sum equals zero. However, this approach would have a time complexity of O(n^3), which is not optimal.

**Step 3: Optimization**
To optimize the solution, we can follow a two-pointer approach combined with sorting the array. Here's the high-level idea:

1. Sort the input array in non-decreasing order.
2. Iterate through each element in the array using a fixed pointer `i`.
3. For each `i`, initialize two pointers `left` and `right`. `left` starts from `i+1`, and `right` starts from the end of the array.
4. Check if `nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]` equals zero.
    - If the sum is zero, add the triplet (`nums[i]`, `nums[left]`, `nums[right]`) to the result set.
    - If the sum is less than zero, increment `left`.
    - If the sum is greater than zero, decrement `right`.
5. Move the `i` pointer to the next distinct number and repeat steps 3-5 until `i` reaches the second-to-last element.

This approach reduces the time complexity to O(n^2).

**Step 4: Walk-through**
Now, let's walk through the optimized solution using the initial example.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
```

1. Sort the array: `[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]`.
2. Initialize the result set: `result = []`.
3. Iterate through each element in the array:
   - For `i = 0` (value = -4):
     - Initialize `left = 1` and `right = 5`.
     - Compute the sum: `-4 + -1 + 2 = -3`.
     - Since the sum is less than zero, increment `left` (now `left = 2`).
     - Compute the sum again: `-4 + -1 + 1 = -4`.
     - Since the sum is equal to zero, add the triplet `[-4, -1, 1]` to the result set.
   - For `i = 1` (value = -1):
     - Initialize `left = 2` and `right = 5`.
     - Compute the sum: `-1 + -1 + 2 = 0`.
     - Since the sum is equal to zero, add the triplet `[-1, -1, 2]` to the result set.
   - For `i = 2` (value = -1):
     - Initialize `left = 3` and `right = 5`.
     - Compute the sum: `-1 + 0 + 

2 = 1`.
     - Since the sum is greater than zero, decrement `right` (now `right = 4`).
     - Compute the sum again: `-1 + 0 + 1 = 0`.
     - Since the sum is equal to zero, add the triplet `[-1, 0, 1]` to the result set.
   - For `i = 3` (value = 0):
     - Initialize `left = 4` and `right = 5`.
     - Compute the sum: `0 + 1 + 2 = 3`.
     - Since the sum is greater than zero, decrement `right` (now `right = 3`).
     - No further calculations needed since the array is sorted.
4. Return the result set: `[[-4, -1, 1], [-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]`.

**Step 5: Implementation**
Now, let's write the code for the optimized solution in C#. I'll explain each step of the implementation as we go.

```csharp
public List<List<int>> ThreeSum(int[] nums)
{
    List<List<int>> result = new List<List<int>>();

    // Step 1: Sort the array
    Array.Sort(nums);

    // Step 2: Iterate through each element
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.Length - 2; i++)
    {
        // Avoid duplicates by skipping the same number at i
        if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1])
            continue;

        int left = i + 1;
        int right = nums.Length - 1;

        // Step 3: Two-pointer approach
        while (left < right)
        {
            int sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];

            if (sum == 0)
            {
                // Step 4: Add the triplet to the result set
                result.Add(new List<int> { nums[i], nums[left], nums[right] });

                // Skip duplicates for left and right pointers
                while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left + 1])
                    left++;
                while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right - 1])
                    right--;

                // Move both pointers towards the center
                left++;
                right--;
            }
            else if (sum < 0)
            {
                // The sum is too small, move left pointer
                left++;
            }
            else
            {
                // The sum is too large, move right pointer
                right--;
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

**Step 6: Big O Analysis**
The time complexity of this solution is dominated by the sorting process, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The subsequent two-pointer approach has a time complexity of O(n^2). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables and the result list, which is required for the output.
